# 1 • worst-syntax-ever
I thought that markdown was too easy, simple, and efficient to use, so I created **Worst Syntax Ever** to solve this problem. I knew that the world was in desperate need of a convoluted, confusing, and frustrating syntax system for styling font. One that would completely destroy the confidence even the most resilient programmers. One that would reduce any self-respecting typist to tears. I created what is essentially a simplified version of PHP.

# 2 • Modes
There are two main modes in WSE, each with its own syntax and conventions. Symbols mode is based on regular ASCII keyboard symbols, while spaces mode uses only the space character.

## 2.1 • Symbols
This is the default system used for parsing worst-syntax-ever. Symbols mode consists primarily of the characters located at the top row of the keyboard, as well as the punctuation marks found to the right of the letter keys.
**` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )**
**[ ] \ ; ' , . / { } | : " < > ?**

### 2.1.1 • Openers
Openers must be used before all expressions in WSE. A regular opener consists of a tilde, followed by the opening bracket, a backtick, a dollar sign, an asterisk, another backtick, an apostrophe, a pipe, and an opening brace.
**~[`$*`'|{**

### 2.1.2 • Closers

## 2.2 • Spaces
