# 1 • worst-syntax-ever
I thought that markdown was too intuitive, simple, and efficient to use, so I created **Worst Syntax Ever** to solve this problem. I knew that the world was in desperate need of a convoluted, confusing, complex, complicated, and frustrating syntax system for styling font. One that would completely destroy the confidence even the most resilient programmers. One that would reduce any self-respecting typist to tears. I created what is essentially a simplified version of PHP.

# 2 • Modes
There are two main modes in WSE, each with its own syntax and conventions. Symbols mode is based on regular ASCII keyboard symbols, while z mode uses only the letter z.

## 2.1 • Symbols
This is the default system used for parsing worst-syntax-ever. Symbols mode consists primarily of the characters located at the top row of the keyboard, as well as the punctuation marks found to the right of the letter keys.
<strong>
` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )
[ ] \ ; ' , . / { } | : " < > ?
</strong>

### 2.1.1 • Openers
Openers must be used before all expressions in WSE. A regular symbol opener consists of a tilde, followed by the opening bracket, a backtick, a dollar sign, an asterisk, another backtick, an apostrophe, a pipe, and an opening brace.
<div>
~[`$*`'|,>{
</div>

### 2.1.2 • Closers
Closers are used to end expressions in WSE. The regular closer expression (not to be confused with the closer regular expression) is similar to a reversed version of an opener, but with a few important differences.
The closer is like a reversed opener, where both the characters and the type of characters are switched around:
<div>
}<,|'`*$`]~<br /><br />
The comma becomes a period:<br /><br />
}<.|'`*$`]~<br /><br />
The pipe becomes a forward slash:<br /><br />
}<./'`*$`]~<br /><br />
The backticks and apostrophes are switched around:<br /><br />
}<./`'*$']~<br /><br />
Another backtick is added to wrap the apostrophes in backticks:<br /><br />
}<./`'*$'`]~<br /><br />
And another tilde is added to the end:<br /><br />
}<./`'$*'`]~~
</div>
